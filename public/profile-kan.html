<h1>Kan Wang - About Me</h1>

<img src="kan-crazyGoose.jpeg" alt="Supergoose">

<p>I am from New York City studying Computer Science at UB. I enjoy programming because I enjoy solving puzzles. During my time at UB, I've enjoyed exploring North Campus and finding some of the hidden gems that the university has to offer. Outside of classes, I spend my time running (recently reached a milestone of 10 continuous miles ðŸ™ˆ), watching movies, and playing video games.</p>
